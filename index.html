       <p>We are a non-profit organization that focuses on the availibility of oppurtunities for children. There are many future-benefitting oppurtunities in this world that are kept from the children of our communities and that needs to change. Now our website targets different fields of practices so the student can choose a field that they might be interested in studying for the future. It is very important that children are aware of what they can achieve and/or do with their lives. Instead of talking on the phone or playing video games they could be prepping for their future. As the children of society we mold the future for ourselves and sooner or later society is going to be dependent on us so the change happpens now.</p>
